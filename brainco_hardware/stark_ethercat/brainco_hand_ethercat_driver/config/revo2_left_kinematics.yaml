# Revo2 left hand kinematics configuration
# The hand is primarily for grasping and doesn't require IK
# Dexterous hands have tree structures (multiple finger branches), not chain structures
# KDL solver only supports chains, so we disable kinematics solvers
# This is appropriate for hands that only need joint-space planning
revo2_left_hand:
  # kinematics_solver: none  # No IK solver needed for joint-space planning
